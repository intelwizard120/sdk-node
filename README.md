# VULCAN UONET+ JavaScript SDK

[![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/wulkanowy/sdk-node?branch=master)](https://bettercodehub.com/)

This project aims to allow access to the VULCAN UONET+ with a JavaScript backend tool (like **Node.js**). Support for the browser environment might be limited, as CORS policies might block access to the UONET+ website from your front-end code.

The goal is to combine the **MOBILE** API (used for Dzienniczek+) and **SCRAPPER** of the website, as well as a **HYBRID** mode combining both modes.

We use [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## Work in progress
**This project is in the faze of initial development. This means versions 0.x.y are used and backward compatibility is not guarented. [Details in SemVer spec](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4)**. At the moment there are also a lot of missing features.
